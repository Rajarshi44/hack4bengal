## Usage Guide

### For Users

1. **Creating a Post**:
   - Click "Create Post" button
   - Enter title and content
   - Add relevant tags
   - Upload images/videos (optional)
   - Click "Create Post" to publish

2. **Engaging with Posts**:
   - Click heart icon to like/unlike
   - View comments by clicking comment count
   - Use filter options to find relevant content
   - Load more posts by scrolling or clicking "Load More"

3. **Managing Posts**:
   - Edit your own posts (title, content, tags, media)
   - Delete your own posts
   - View engagement metrics

### For Developers

1. **Adding New Features**:
   - Extend TypeScript interfaces in `/types/posts.ts`
   - Add API endpoints following existing patterns
   - Update service layer in `/services/postsService.ts`
   - Implement UI components with consistent styling

2. **Database Operations**:
   - Use MongoDB aggregation for complex queries
   - Maintain referential integrity between collections
   - Cache frequently accessed data (likes count, comments count)

3. **Media Handling**:
   - Validate file types and sizes on both client and server
   - Use Cloudinary transformations for optimization
   - Implement proper error handling for upload failures

## Performance Considerations

- **Pagination**: Load posts in small batches (10 per page)
- **Image Optimization**: Cloudinary auto-optimization reduces bandwidth
- **Caching**: Like counts and comment counts are cached in posts
- **Lazy Loading**: Media is loaded on demand
- **Aggregation Pipelines**: Efficient database queries with joins

## Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- **File Upload Security**: Strict file type and size limitations
- **User Verification**: Only verified users can post
